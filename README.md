# Global Health & Development Analytics

## Overview
This project analyses global patterns in life expectancy using cross-country panel data from the World Bank and international health datasets. The study explores how economic development and health expenditure relate to population health outcomes across countries and over time.

The analysis is intended as an academic-style exploratory and statistical investigation rather than a causal policy evaluation.

## Research Questions
- How has global life expectancy evolved over time?
- How does life expectancy vary across countries?
- What is the relationship between income, health expenditure, and life expectancy?
- Do higher-income and higher-spending countries consistently exhibit better health outcomes?

---

## Data Sources
- **World Bank – World Development Indicators (WDI)**
  - GDP per capita (current US$)
  - Current health expenditure (% of GDP)
- **International Life Expectancy Dataset**
  - Life expectancy at birth by country and year

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and harmonisation
2. Construction of a country–year panel dataset
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Correlation analysis
5. Bivariate and multivariate OLS regression

All analyses are conducted using Python.

## Key Findings
- Global life expectancy has increased steadily over time.
- Significant cross-country disparities in life expectancy persist.
- GDP per capita is strongly associated with higher life expectancy, particularly at lower income levels.
- Health expenditure is positively correlated with life expectancy, though with substantial heterogeneity.

---

## Limitations
- The analysis is observational and descriptive in nature.
- Estimated relationships should not be interpreted as causal effects.
- Potential omitted variables include institutional quality, education, demographics, and health system efficiency.
